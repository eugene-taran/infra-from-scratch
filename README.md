# infra-from-scratch

> **A monorepo for building modern developer infrastructure from scratch — live on Twitch.**

This project is an educational, in-public build of core developer tooling and cloud infrastructure, using Node.js, Terraform, Google Cloud, and more. The goal: learn, document, and templatize everything needed to bootstrap production-grade platforms fast.
